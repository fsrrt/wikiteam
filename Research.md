**Are you a researcher?** If you have conducted any research about wikis using [our software](http://code.google.com/p/wikiteam/source/browse/) or the [backups we made available](AvailableBackups.md), we would be glad to hear from your experience.

If you want to explore wiki communities, [WikiEvidens](http://code.google.com/p/wikievidens/) is a tool (under development) for statistical analysis and visualization of wikis. We recommend it!

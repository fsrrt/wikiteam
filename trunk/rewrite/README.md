## WikiTeam dumpgenerator.py rewrite
This is the rewrite of WikiTeam's dumpgenerator.py. It is aimed towards getting native API support when downloading wikis and to avoid the use of screen scraping when doing so (which is quite hacky and not ideal).

Note: THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET, patches welcome.

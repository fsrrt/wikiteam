**Stuff to do**, soon or later, or in the near future.

dumpgenerator.py:
  * [GUI](GUI.md) in a separate script (TKinter, very simple and cross-platform)
  * i18n
  * Improve the inline help

Other:
  * WikiCrawler to find all wikis on the Internet
    * Google query: "special pages" + "permanent link" + "what links here" -site:wikipedia.org -site:wikimedia.org -site:mediawiki.org -site:wikiquote.org -site:wiktionary.org -site:wikia.com
  * New scripts for other wiki engines
  * Wikimedia Commons download manager (in progress...)
  * Search for tools which can read XML dumps and show the article content: WikiTaxi (only for Windows)
  * Get more mirrors set up so that our backups are available throughout the internet (and the globe)
  * WikiIndex bot which reads articles about wikis, generates a backup, upload to Google Code (using the command line uploader), and paste the backup url into the infobox.

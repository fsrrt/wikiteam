*Are you a researcher?* If you have conducted any research about wikis using [http://code.google.com/p/wikiteam/source/browse/ our software] or the [http://code.google.com/p/wikiteam/downloads/list backups we made available], we would be glad to hear from your experience.

If you want to explore wiki communities, [http://code.google.com/p/wikievidens/ WikiEvidens] is a tool (under development) for statistical analysis and visualization of wikis. We recommend it!

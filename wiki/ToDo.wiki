Stuff to do, soon or later, or in the near future.

dumpgenerator.py:
 * GUI in a separate script (TKinter, very simple and cross-platform)
 * i18n
 * Improve the inline help

Other:
 * WikiCrawler to find all wikis on the Internet
 * New scripts for other wiki engines
 * Wikimedia Commons download manager (in progress...)
 * Search for tools which can read XML dumps and show the article content: WikiTaxi (only for Windows)
 * Get more mirrors set up so that our backups are available throughout the internet (and the globe)

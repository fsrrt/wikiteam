 # Download all the files from both [https://code.google.com/p/wikiteam/downloads/list this website] and [http://mirrors.sdboyd56.com/WikiTeam/ ScottDB wikibackups site].
 # Download all the files from the Sourceforge mirror, which already has a mirror network to allow you to choose a mirror closest to you.

= Introduction =

Wikipedia articles are constantly deleted, sometimes so quickly that you don't even notice. They are sometimes put in the speedy deletion category http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Speedy_deletion and its subcategories so that administrators notice them and delete those pages.

However, these speedily-deleted articles may contain useful information to other wikis, but isn't notable in Wikipedia. We think its a shame for it to be deleted and hidden from public's view, and thus we are doing this project to allow these deleted articles have hopes of coming back to Wikipedia again, once they passed the notability tests.

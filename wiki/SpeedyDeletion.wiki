= Introduction =

Wikipedia articles are constantly deleted, sometimes so quickly that you dont even notice. They are sometimes put in the speedy deletion category http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Speedy_deletion and its subcategories. I have a cron job that runs once an half hour. 


= Code =

The code is here 
https://github.com/h4ck3rm1k3/wikiteam

It is a merger of the pywikibot and the wikiteam code.

== s3 Buckets == 
It uses boto/s3 to upload the buckets, they are currently created by hand, but use the month name.

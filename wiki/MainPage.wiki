== We archive wikis, from Wikipedia to tiniest wikis ==

There are [http://wikiindex.org thousands of wikis] in the Internet. Everyday some of them are no longer publicly available and, due to lack of [http://code.google.com/p/wikiteam/downloads/list?can=1 backups], lost. Many people download tons of media files (music, books, etc) from the Internet, implementing a kind of distributed backup. Wikis, most of them under free licenses, disappear from time to time because nobody grabbed a copy of them. That is a shame that we would like to solve.
